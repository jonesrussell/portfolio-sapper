## ‚ùì What is this?

The site that builds from this repository can be found [here](https://www.jonesrussell42.xyz).

This is an extremely opinionated Svelte/Sapper project intended for my own use. That being said, this is the gist:

- [Sapper for Svelte](https://sapper.svelte.dev/)
  - [Official VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
  - Inside Svelte components, thanks to [`svelte-preprocess`](https://github.com/kaisermann/svelte-preprocess)
- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)
  - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
    - [Official VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)
  - [postcss-import](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import)
  - [PurgeCSS](https://www.purgecss.com/)
  - [CSSNano](https://cssnano.co/)
  - Inside Svelte components, thanks to [`svelte-preprocess`](https://github.com/kaisermann/svelte-preprocess)
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
  - Automatic building and deployment to X, triggered on commits to `main` or `master`
- [Progressive Web App (PWA)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) best practices set up
  - [`manifest.json`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest)'s most important fields filled out
  - High [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) audit score
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
  - [VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
  - `eslint:fix` package script

## üß≠ Project Status

Sapper is going to change.

Until `create-svelte` and `@sveltejs/kit` are ready, this is a great base.

```

### ‚¨áÔ∏è Install Dependencies

You need to be using version 12 or higher of Node;

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jonesrussell/portfolio-sapper.git
cd portfolio-sapper
npm install
```

## üõ† Usage

### üß™ Development

```sh
npm run sapper:dev
```

### üî• Deployment to kubernetes

This will create a production build for you before deploying.

```sh
kubectl deploy -f kubernetes.yaml
```

### üî® Testing Production Builds Locally

```sh
npm run prod
npm run start
```

### ‚ö° Web app

Many of the fields in `static/manifest.json` (`short_name`, `name`, `description`, `categories`, `theme_color`, and `background_color`) are filled with demonstrative values that won't match your site. Similarly, you've got to take new screenshots to replace the included `static/screenshot-1.png` and `static/screenshot-2.png` files. If you want, you can add [app shortcut definitions for "add to home screen" on Android](https://web.dev/app-shortcuts/#define-app-shortcuts-in-the-web-app-manifest). Once you change `theme_color`, update the `meta name="theme-color"` tag in `src/template.html` to match.

The [Apple touch icon](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/ConfiguringWebApplications/ConfiguringWebApplications.html), favicon, and `logo-` files (also all in the `static` directory) are created by placing the logo within a "safe area" centered circle that takes up 80% of the canvas's dimension. For instance, the constraining circle in `logo-512.png` is 512 √ó 0.80 = 409.6 ‚âà 410 pixels wide and tall.

### üó∫ Source maps

This project base comes with [source maps](https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-source-maps) enabled during development and disabled during production for the best compromise between performance and developer experience. You can change this behavior through the `sourcemap` variable in `rollup.config.js`.

## TODO

Add 'validate' back to the end of 'export'
