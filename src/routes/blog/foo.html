<p>Ahnii! I previously wrote a command line utility named ‘<a
    href="/_posts/2020-11-21-quickly-view-project-dependencies-on-the-cli.html">packages</a>’ which simply prints a list
  of project dependencies on the command line.</p>
<p>I found that I also often want to see a list of scripts in package.json, so I wrote another utility I’ve named
  ‘scripts’, observe:</p>
<p class="center"><img src="https://blog.jonesrussell42.xyz/src=" /assets/img/screenshot-scripts.png"
    alt="scripts screenshot" class="half center" /></p>
<p>You can accomplish the same with ‘sed’, but it’s quite a command to remember, observe:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge">
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre
      class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sed</span> <span class="nt">-n</span> <span class="nt">-e</span> <span class="s1">'/scripts/,/},/ p'</span> package.json</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>
<p class="center"><img src="/assets/img/screenshot-scripts-sed.png" alt="scripts sed screenshot" /></p>
<p>Check it out at <a href="https://github.com/jonesrussell/scripts">https://github.com/jonesrussell/scripts</a> or
  simply install it and try:</p>
<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge">
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code>npm i <span class="nt"">-g</span> @jonesrussell42/scripts</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>
